    "### How to pass a variable number of arguments to a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to pass a variable number of arguments to a function?\n",
    "In this chapter we'll go through common questions on Python functions. We'll start with the problem of passing a variable number of arguments to a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Argument types\n",
    "Functions can have the following argument types:\n",
    "    - positional arguments\n",
    "    - and keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Positional arguments\n",
    "Positional arguments are just simple arguments we pass to a function. For example, let's define a function that multiplies two numbers and returns the result. Here is the output of the call.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. *args\n",
    "Actually, we can have a variable number of positional arguments in our function definition. We can do this by using a name prefixed with an asterisk as an argument. In this case, we can call our function with as many positional arguments as we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let's see what happens if our function body will simply print our input. The arguments are interpreted as a tuple!\n",
    "\n",
    "    It means we can iterate through it. Calling the function will print each single item.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Redefining multiply()\n",
    "Let's redefine our multiply() function now. Calling it with a variable number of arguments works! Notice that the name args is just a convention: we can use any name we like.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Substituting args with nums won't change anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Another use of single asterisk *\n",
    "The single asterisk also has another use. Assume we have a function with a predefined number of positional arguments. Instead of precisely defining each argument in the call,\n",
    "\n",
    "    we can first create an iterable object, for example a tuple. Then, we pass the tuple prefixed with an asterisk to the function call. It unwraps into the corresponding arguments. We can also define only part of the necessary arguments, and add some more in the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can actually do the unwrapping with a variable number of arguments as well. We define our Iterable and call the function with it prefixed with an asterisk.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def multiply(*args):\n",
    "\n",
    "        result = 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "        for arg in args:\n",
    "        \n",
    "            result = result * arg\n",
    "        \n",
    "        return result\n",
    "    \n",
    "    nums = (2,3,4,5)\n",
    "\n",
    "    miltiply(*nums)\n",
    "\n",
    "    > 120\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Keyword arguments\n",
    "Keyword arguments are positional arguments having default values. For example, let's define a function. We can call it as usual. We can also skip the arguments forcing the function to use its default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Or we can precisely specify the names in any sequence we want. It is also possible to use a variable amount of keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **kwargs\n",
    "This is achieved by using a name prefixed with a double asterisk as an argument. If we define the following function and call it with a variable number of named arguments, the output will represent a dictionary. Passing an argument without a name will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def func_with_kwargs(**kwargs):\n",
    "\n",
    "           print(kwargs)\n",
    "       \n",
    "    func_with_kwargs(arg1=1,arg2=2,arg3=3)\n",
    "\n",
    "    > {arg1:1, arg2:2, arg3:3}\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Redefining multiply()\n",
    "Let's redefine our multiply() function with the **kwargs argument. The difference to our previous implementation is that we iterate through the key-value pairs instead of simple values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def multiply(**kwargs):\n",
    "    \n",
    "        result = 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "        for (key,value) in kwargs.items():\n",
    "        \n",
    "        print(key + ' = ' + str(value))\n",
    "        \n",
    "        result = result * value\n",
    "        \n",
    "    return result\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "20. Calling multiply_kwargs()\n",
    "Let's check how our function works! Here is the output we get.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. Another use of double asterisk **\n",
    "As with the example on single asterisk, double asterisk can have another meaning. Assume, we have a function with a predefined number of keyword arguments. By default it returns this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define the following dictionary with the key names matching the argument names in our function. Then, let's pass it prefixed with double asterisk to the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have a dictionary defining only the part of the arguments. In this case the output looks like this. The argument that was not defined in the dictionary takes its default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inserting other keys in the dictionary will result in TypeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unwrapping works if a function has a variable number of arguments. We just define our dictionary and pass it to the function prefixed with double asterisk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "26. Argument order\n",
    "A function can combine different types of arguments. But the order should be followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, positional arguments.\n",
    "arg1, arg2\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, their extension. *args\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, keyword arguments.kwarg1 = 10, kwarg2=20\n",
    "\n",
    "And their extension. **kwargs\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course we can skip some arguments if they are not needed. However, it is better to follow the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def func(arg1, arg2, *args)\n",
    "    def func(arg1, arg2, **kwargs)\n",
    "    def func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking this rule can cause unexpected behavior and errors."

    "### What is a lambda expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Definition\n",
    "    A lambda expression or a lambda function is a short function having the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "    > lambda arg1, arg2,... : expression(arg1,arg2,..)\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a lambda keyword, the sequence of arguments followed by a colon, and the expression that uses these arguments. A good example is a squared number. After assigning this expression to a variable, we can use this variable with a value enclosed in round brackets. In this case, the lambda expression is evaluated for x equal 4.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     > squared = lambda x: x**2\n",
    "     \n",
    "     > squared(4)\n",
    "     \n",
    "     > 16\n",
    "     \n",
    "The same happens if we use more arguments. Let's define the expression raising x to the power of y. Using this variable with the following values implies evaluating the lambda expression for 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "     > power = lambda x,y: x**y\n",
    "     \n",
    "     > power(2,3)\n",
    "     \n",
    "     > 16\n",
    "     \n",
    "7. Missing argument\n",
    "Remember that missing an argument in the call results in TypeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Comparison to normal function definition\n",
    "Let's compare lambda functions to normal function definitions, taking the example on squaring a number. Using normal definition this expression can be represented like this. As can be seen, one of the advantages of lambda expressions is writing less code for simple operations. Let's have a deeper comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "The def keyword can be associated with the lambda keyword.\n",
    "A lambda expression can be assigned to some variable, whereas normal definition must have a name.\n",
    "Here are the arguments.\n",
    "And finally, the operation itself. Notice that in lambda expressions we don't need to specify the return keyword. The final operation already implies that the corresponding result will be returned. As can be seen, calling functions is identical in both cases, and both functions have the same output.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Passing lambda function as an argument\n",
    "02:01 - 02:41\n",
    "So, what are other advantageous sides of lambda functions in addition to being short? Assume we have the following function. The first argument is just a number. The second one is a function itself that has one argument in its definition. The functions that represent arguments to other functions are usually called callback functions or simply callbacks. Recall squared_normal() we defined before. We can pass it as a callback argument to our function_with_callback(). Do you notice the inefficiency here?\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Passing lambda function as an argument\n",
    "To do a tiny little thing, we have to define an entire function and pass it as an argument. This can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Passing lambda function as an argument\n",
    "We can pass a lambda expression directly in a function call. This is very handy when a callback represents something short like in this example. Such a modification simplifies the code and its readability. Notice that we don't need to give any name to the lambda expression in this case: all we need is its main components.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Definition\n",
    "Since we don't define a name for a lambda expression, it is often called an anonymous function. Therefore, we can add \"anonymous\" descriptor in brackets in our previous definition. This property can be supported by another example. Recall the lambda expression we defined before. We assigned it to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Actually, it is not necessary. We can define a lambda expression and call it directly by passing a necessary value. This supports the idea of anonymity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    > (lambda x: x**2) (3)\n",
    "    > 9\n",
    "    \n",
    "19. Ternary operator\n",
    "Let's discuss one more thing on lambda expressions. Consider this simple function that returns 'odd' or 'even' depending on the number passed. We can substitute the if-else block with\n",
    "\n",
    "    > def odd_or_even(num):\n",
    "        > \n",
    "        >> return 'even' if num % 2 == 0 else 'odd'\n",
    "        \n",
    "with its one-line version called ternary operator. It returns 'even' if the condition between 'if' and 'else' is fulfilled. Otherwise, it returns 'odd'. Since it's a one-line version, we can use it in a lambda expression, which can be very useful sometimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > odd_or_even = lambda num: 'even' if num % 2 == 0 else 'odd'\n",
    "\n",
    "22. Practical use\n",
    "Although lambda expressions are easy to use, they are not substitutes to the normal function definition and have to be used only when it's really necessary! Better to follow practical guidelines: to use lambda expressions within function bodies to handle some small tasks or use them as callback"

    "\n",
    "#### map()\n",
    "\n",
    "    This function can take a bunch of iterable objects, like lists. and a mapping function that defines a rule which says how items with the same index will be mapped to a new object. Note that the amount of arguments in the mapping function equals the amount of considered Iterables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. map() with single Iterable\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let's consider the easiest mapping with a single Iterable. We want the square of each element in this list. First, we need to define our mapping function. Next, we pass it together with our list to the map() function. The output represents a map object. It is Iterable, meaning we can use it in a for loop, or within the list constructor. map is also an Iterator. It means we can retrieve consecutive elements by using the next() function.\n",

Then, we pass it together with our list to the reduce() function. Compared to map() or filter(), it simply returns a value. What happens here? The first pair gives 4 as the minimum. Then, 4 is compared to 5. 4 is still the minimum. Then, 4 is compared to 1. 1 is the new minimum. Finally, 1 is compared to 9. 1 is the final result.\n",

    "### What is recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is recursion?\n",
    "Now, let's dive into the most frequent topic in coding interviews: recursion!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let's start with a definition: Recursion is the process of defining a problem in terms of itself. Or, more technically: Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself as a subroutine.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example: Factorial $n!$\n",
    "\n",
    "    To understand recursion, we will use the example of factorial calculation. A factorial is a sequential multiplication of integers starting from the number itself down to 1. For example, let's consider n = 4. The above written expression will look like that. It's 4 multiplied by 3, then multiplied by 2 and one at the end. Therefore, the result is 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Factorial - Iterative Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "    Notice that a factorial can be re-written in the opposite direction: from 1 to n. This is the most common representation for an iterative algorithm to calculate a factorial. Let's choose 4 again and go through the algorithm. We initialize our temporary variable result to 1. Then, we get into the loop. The first iteration gives us 1 again. The second iteration gives us 2. Then, we get 6. And finally, we get 24. As we can see, the iterative approach does its job. However, there is a more elegant way to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Factorial - Recursive Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "    Notice that a factorial can also be written like this: the number itself multiplied by the factorial of a lesser number. We can write it as the following Python function. And this is a pure recursion: function calling itself! But what's wrong with that code? We dive into an infinite amount of calls! To change that we must have a stopping criterion or a so-called base case that will prevent infinite calling by defining a well-defined output for a given input. Let's recall that the multiplication sequence in the factorial ends with 1: no more further calls! Therefore, we can define the base case for the factorial function when n equals 1. Taking this into account, let's modify our function. Now, we can be sure that our factorial will be calculated correctly for all the numbers higher than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "        def fact_rec(n):  \n",
    "            if n == 1:\n",
    "                return 1 \n",
    "            return n * fact_rec(n-1) \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Wrapping Up\n",
    "\n",
    "    Great! We recalled what recursion is. To wrap up, recursive functions consist of two main parts: A recursive call to a smaller problem of itself, and a base case that prevents infinite calling. Now, where can we encounter recursion in data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Example - Decision Trees\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A good example of it is decision trees! Why? Let's recall that a decision tree is a model that is used to predict different outcomes depending on its logical structure. In the case of classification trees, the outcome is a category as depicted on the slide.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Traversing a Decision Tree\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Given a new sample, how can we traverse the tree to find out its category? Right, we can use recursion! Let's create a pseudo algorithm for the given classification tree. First, let's define our function. It should return a category given a sample and a node of the tree. In the function body we check if the node has a splitting. If there is a splitting, we choose either left or right child node depending on the conditions met. And here is our recursion! Given a child node, we apply a recursive call to the same function! What should be done next? Right, a base case! We did not specify it. It should be defined if the node does not have a splitting afterward.\n",
