    "### What is the difference between a NumPy array and a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the difference between a NumPy array and a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "    We'll cover some common questions about scientific computing in Python. We'll start with NumPy arrays and compare them to Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. NumPy array\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is a special data structure from the NumPy module representing a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. The easiest way to create an array is to pass a list of values to the array() constructor. At the first glance, there isn't a big difference to Python's native lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Similarities between an array and a list\n",
    "\n",
    "    Both data structures are Iterables. In both cases we can use indexing to access elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Moreover, NumPy arrays and Python lists can be modified similarly. What's so special about NumPy arrays then?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Compared to lists, NumPy arrays are optimized for high efficiency computations. How? First of all, NumPy arrays only store data of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. dtype property\n",
    "    \n",
    "    When we have an array, we can retrieve the data type it stores by accessing its .dtype property. In this case, our array stores integers represented by 64 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Changing the data type of an element\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Compared to lists, if we try to modify an element with a different data type, we'll get ValueError.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Specifying the data type explicitly\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Actually, we can explicitly specify the data type when we create an array using the dtype keyword argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Independently from the list we pass, we can specify other data types like a string, for example. The output we see here means a one-character string.\n",
    "\n",
    "        num_array = np.array([1,2,3,4,5], dtype=np.type('str'))\n",
    "        num_array.dtype\n",
    "        > dtype('<U1')\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Object as a data type\n",
    "\n",
    "    If we want an array to behave like a list with respect to modification, we can use the dtype equal to 'O' which stands for Object. In this case, we can mix data types. However, we also limit the set of operations we can apply to such an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "        num_array = np.array([1,2,3,4,5], dtype = np.dtype('O'))\n",
    "    \n",
    "12. Difference between an array and a list - Accessing items\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The second property of NumPy arrays is that they offer a special way to access their elements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Let's assume we have this two-dimensional list. As an array it can be defined like this. To retrieve a single item, say the 8 in this case, both lists and arrays provide similar options.\n",
    "\n",
    "        array2d = np.array([\n",
    "            [1,2,3,4,5],\n",
    "            [6,7,8,9,10],\n",
    "            [11,12,13,14,15]\n",
    "        ])\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Accessing items\n",
    "\n",
    "    With arrays though, it's not necessary to specify additional square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Retrieve 8\n",
    "        array2d[1,2]\n",
    "        > 8\n",
    "\n",
    "    But how do we retrieve an entire data block?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The solution for a list can be tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An array provides a more elegant and efficient way via slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "        array2d[0:2,1:4]\n",
    "        > array([2,3,4],\n",
    "                [7,8,9])\n",
    "\n",
    "18. Difference between an array and a list\n",
    "\n",
    "    Third, operations work differently on arrays. For simplicity, we'll focus only on numeric arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Operations +, -, *, / with lists\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let's recall that, given two lists, most of the simple mathematical operations will result in TypeError. Addition is an exception; it concatenates given lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In case of NumPy arrays, operations are performed element-wise. As a result, we get a new array.\n",
    "\n",
    "        num_array1 = np.array([1,2,3])\n",
    "        num_array2 = np.array([10,20,30])\n",
    "        num_array1 + num_array2\n",
    "        > array([11,22,33])\n",
    "        num_array1*num_array2\n",
    "        > array([10,40,90])\n",
    "\n",
    "    The same applies to multidimensional arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. Conditional operations\n",
    "\n",
    "    Conditional operations are especially useful. Applying them on an array returns a new array of booleans indicating whether the condition is satisfied or not. The cool part is that we can use these conditions to filter our arrays. This operation takes much more effort with lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "        num_array = np.array([-5,-4,-3,0,3,4,5])\n",
    "        num_array[num_array <0]\n",
    "        > array([-5,-4,-3])\n",
    "\n",
    "23. Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "    Another important feature of arrays is broadcasting. It describes how operations work on arrays of different dimensions. For example, what happens if we multiply this array by 3? We certainly know the answer for lists: they get extended. In case of arrays, each element is multiplied by 3 resulting in a new array. The same applies to other operations. We say that 3 broadcasts itself to all the array elements meaning that 3 operates on each element separately.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        num_list = [1,2,3]\n",
    "        num_list * 3\n",
    "        > [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3]\n",
    "        \n",
    "        num_array = np.array([1,2,3])\n",
    "        num_array * 3\n",
    "        > array([3,6,9])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "24. Broadcasting with multidimensional arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can do broadcasting with multidimensional arrays. For this example, the one-dimensional array broadcasts itself to all three rows of the two-dimensional array. Broadcasting is applied to rows by default. If we want to broadcast to columns, we need to modify our one-dimensional array to be a column vector. And here's the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "        array1d = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])\n",
    "        \n",

    "\n",
    "2. Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "    First, let's pick a dataset. We'll work with data on 100 students and their performance on different subjects. Each performance score varies between 0 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Default .apply()\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the .apply() method. It requires one argument - a function that, by default, is applied on each column of a DataFrame. However, the output of .apply() may differ. For example, applying the sqrt() function results in a DataFrame with square roots of original values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Default .apply()\n",

    "However, using the mean() function returns a Series. Why?\n",

    "00:53 - 01:10\n",
    "The columns we apply the function to are passed as pandas Series. When we use sqrt(), we simply modify each value in a column and return an object of the same size. When we use mean(), we summarize the Series with a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Default .apply(): own functions\n",
    "01:10 - 01:24\n",
    "For example, let's define a function halving our scores. We get a modified DataFrame because passing columns to our defined function results in an object of the same size.\n",

    "7. Default .apply(): own functions\n",
